# MusicHub

##Author: John Wright, September 2022

### Description
MusicHub was an assignment from my NZ Diploma in Software Development to create an API that retrieved data from a MongoDB non-relational database. 
The database contains a collection of musical tracks with information about artist, title, genre, year etc. The application can retrieve single tracks, 
or all tracks from a given artist or genre. All database CRUD operations are possible, with API paths allowing updates to track information and the 
ability to delete them.

I used the MERN stack to achieve this - Mongo, Express, React, Node.js There is no fornt end to this application, I ran tests on it using Postman
and Chrome web browser using URLs.
