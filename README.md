# MusicHub

##Author: John Wright, September 2022

### Description
MusicHub was an assignment from my NZ Diploma in Software Development to create an API that retrieved data from a MongoDB non-relational database. 
I used the MERN stack to achieve this - Mongo, Express, React, Node.js

There is no fornt end to this application, I ran tests on it using Postman.
